"October 11, 2020",Great TV!,"I bought this TV because I wanted a TV to be the size of the wall in my small living room in a condo. I loved this TV but ended up returning it for a couple reasons. 1) It was too big. Never thought there would be such thing as too big, but it was. The living room is small so the TV felt too big. I felt like I couldnt take in the whole picture as I should. 2) I installed a wall mount and The TVs mounting holes are not centered but on the lower portion of the TV back. It made it mount a lot higher than I intended. A TV this size would be great for a larger size room where the viewing space is at least 12ft. away from the TV. This TV is great for the following reasons. - Roku TV has a lot more customizations and features - Roku allows you to pause live TV by adding a USB. - Seems to be faster and more stable than the Android TV. - Roku app to control the TV. Android tv has no phone options at all. - Too much to mention. If youre debating on an Android TV vs the Roku. I suggest the Roku. The Android option seems like a newer option but the Roku has so many more features. Some of the Roku TV brands offer you the option to use voice control with the Roku TV.

I'm a senior and tech challenged so I didn't know what Roku is, or the difference between QLED and LED. Due to the Covid 19 stay at home orders, my local Walmart was sold out of every brand except the 43inch TCL Roku. And it was on sale for $208! I figured I couldnt pass up the price and the store clerk said it would be returnable within 30 days. So I get it home, very easily plugged in but i forgot my Internet provider login. Had to call COMCAST, but i lucked out and got a service tech who had two TCL's in his house and loved them. So not only did he reset my PW, he also showed me all the great apps and how to change settings/subscriptions, etc. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS TV! The screen clarity is perfect, love the remote, and I honestly couldn't be happier. I only wish I had gotten one of these TVs sooner! Hundreds of apps, each with a boatload of tv shows and movies.

Either way, i didn't bother to return the tv because i felt like maybe it wont be too much of a problem. I should have returned it. When i woke up this morning, it looked like this (see pictures). Im not sure what happened there but now i have no TV. The TV was wonderful while it lasted. Great picture and size. Love that i can access Netflix and Youtube without have to Chromecast. If I want to cast to the TV, i can just do it without buying anything additional. It makes life easy. Looks like there are a few others who are having trouble with receiving damaged TVs.

I was lucky enough with the first one in that I was able to return it and send it off for repair to eventually have it replaced with a new one, however after the second one stopped working I had to work with TCL support and the lowest bidder for local on site repair. Long story short, I bought a new LG 75 after dealing with that. Please avoid this purchase; I am kicking myself now for not reading the bad reviews.

Felt like that was kind of deceptive, especially since the 40 inch model I bought last year included AV ports. Should be clearly marked especially since older game consoles don't use HDMI. That being said, picture is crisp, TV is light, so easy to put together and set up apps that a child could do it.

Seems it was handled with great care; there were no flaws, no cracked screens, no lines, broken parts, etc. Works perfectly. Also, it arrived WAY sooner than expected; I ordered it yesterday afternoon and it arrived THIS MORNING. I literally woke up and checked tracking and it was already on my porch lol. Walmart still has it arriving tomorrow, but it's already here and in my possession. I did purchase the 3yr Protection Plan as well just for added piece of mind. I'm also just shocked at how large it actually is. I dunno why, but I was expecting it to be a little smaller, but 43 inches is a pretty good size, I'm using it in my bedroom and it's perfect. I actually almost purchased a 50"" but I'm actually glad I didn't do it; would have been too much! Anyway, as far as the early arrival, I do believe it also had to do with me having it shipped from my local store; the closer the store that you order it from, the faster it will arrive. Thankful to whoever handled my package because they did a great job and I had no issues. Your mileage may vary depending where you are and whether or not you are lucky enough to end up with careful handlers. Set up was easy; just waiting for my new stand to get here so I can set that up and have the tv on that rather than on the floor for the time being. But it'll be here in 2 more days. I haven't watched television since 2016 so this whole thing is new to me. I consider myself tech savvy though so it's not really an issue and I do feel this interface is easy-going even for someone who isn't tech-savvy. Anyway, I'm satisfied with my purchase.

Even though we have a small soundbar from our previous TV (which was only 24""), we didn't need it, because the sound from this TV was excellent. It is in a small room, so we definitely don't need surround sound or anything similar. In fact, a more complicated sound system would be overwhelming for us. Some reviews criticized the ""design,"" saying that it has a black plastic bezel, which is true, but I really don't care about whether it has a black bezel or a chrome edging. Things like that are totally irrelevant to me. I am watching the program, not the bezel! The picture is not going to compare with a $2,000 TV, but it is light years ahead of anything we have had before, and it is just an amazing value for the price paid. My husband has very low vision due to glaucoma, and he was no longer able to read captions on our former TV, or to really see what was going on. He can see everything on this new TV, without any strain or stress, so this is a life-changing purchase for us. I did take Walmart's extended warranty, just in case anything fails over the next few years, but at only $219 for the TV and about $30 for the warranty, it is nothing short of unbelievable.","TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",5.0

"November 15, 2020","Great TV, horrible delivery","I am very pleased with my purchase. Its a lovely TV, The picture is bright and the sound is amazing. The speakers are a 8/10. The navigation and set up is simple. The remote is equivalent to the remote of the roku stick. Very lightweight. I used hello tech through Walmart to mount the TV. They did an amazing job. They had plenty availability and my tech Carlos was very professional. The only CON was the delivery. Walmart was great about notifying me that the TV shipped and expected arrival. However, FEDEX Ground was horrible. I live in a secured multi level apartment building. The driver left the TV in the mail room unattended. I had no idea the TV was downstairs until my neighbor who happened to be checking her mail came and told me. I had no way of getting the TV to my apartment on the 4th floor. This was unacceptable. They lacked professionalism and they were very careless. For this reason, I will not order large products from Walmart again. Very disappointed with delivery and the bottom of the box was open by the time it reached my apartment. I suggest Walmart uses a different courier.","TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",4.0
"November 10, 2020",Nice- beware of the white light when TV is off.,"This is a great TV. The built in Roku is easy to set up and navigate. Picture is very nice. I gave it 4 stars because there is a white light on the bottom of the TV that is the receiver for the remote commands. When the TV is off this white light is very bright. I bought the TV for the bedroom but because of this light, I had to switch it out with another one that I had in my home.","TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",4.0
"November 11, 2020",Poor picture quality - JVC's is better,"After trying a WebOS Android TV, I decided that I liked Roku's OS/platform more having used a Roku device. I decided to try the TCL 43"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 43S421. To further confirm my choice, I put this one side-by-side with the the LG 43"" Class 4K UHD 2160P Smart TV to compare the two. A question mark for me was if Roku TV meant that it had only the Roku channel as part of the channel list? Or is it using as built-in Roku device? I was happy to find that it is its own platform/OS and looks and feels just like my Roku device that I have enjoyed. PROs: Setup was a cinch. uses a standard wall mount of 100 mm X 100 mm VESA. Ethernet network cable for wired network is also available which is my preference (over Wi-Fi). Easy setup wizard. We were watching our shows in a matter of minutes. Great sound quality. This was setup in our family room which isn't a large room and the built-in speakers did nicely. Channel finder was able to locate about 10 more channels from my antenna than my previous TV as well as the LG TV that I compared it to. The primary subscription channels were readily available: Prime, Hulu, Disney , Netflix, CBS All Access, NBC Peacock, Apple TV. While on over the air antenna, hitting left arrow has a guide for the channels which makes it easy to see the programming schedule and browse the channels. CONs: Fuzzy picture and despite the 60 Hz refresh rate seemed to drop or miss frames for some of the movement. I noticed this while watching the News. Compared to the LG TV, the picture quality was a stark difference. Also, I didn't like how the remote control for the Roku TVs doesn't have any numbers (including this one). We have an antenna on the roof for over the air broadcasts and would have to change channels by way of up or down arrow. Ultimately, I chose to return this TV and go for JVC 43"" Class 4K UHD 2160p LED Roku Smart TV LT-43MAW595. I kept with the Roku style despite the missing number buttons on the remote. I am much happier with the JVC TV's picture quality and so far I don't have any regrets exchanging this one for the JVC.","TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",2.0

This TV is only a 60hz refresh rate and now my new Xbox Series X is basically a waste of a buy since I can't play games as 120FPS and its no better than my Xbox one.,"TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",1.0

"August 17, 2020","Disappointing, despite some great features.","I had high hopes for this TV, but was ultimately disappointed. First the good: I really like the Roku operating system. It's easy to use. Hundreds (thousands?) of apps that load quickly. The menus are fairly intuitive and their are lots of options to configure the inputs to work the way you want them to. The built in speakers were loud and clear - no need for an additional soundbar. The disappointment came with the picture quality. Bright, bold colors looked okay, but scenes set at night or with a lot of contrast looked washed out. Changing the color / contrast / brightness and contrast settings did nothing to resolve the problem.

"October 20, 2019","FOR CORD-CUTTERS, this TV is AWESOME!!!","1. After scanning for local channels (using an antenna - we're using rabbit ears!), the TV will ask, ""Set up Live TV Pause?"" That's right: it will PAUSE LIVE TV, just like a DVR/TiVo, once you plug in a 16+GB USB Flash Drive. It also allows you quick replay, which also pops up closed captioning, again, just like a DVR/TiVo So, if you're the one who says, ""what did she just say?"", you hit the quick replay button, it backs up about 3 seconds, replays the scene WITH CLOSED CAPTIONS! 2. The channel selection shows up a CHANNEL GUIDE, with what's on for several hours for each channel. (Yes, just like a DVR/TiVo - it's the chorus line for this review) 3.

"September 19, 2020",Great TV for the price HDR is really weak !,"I was very skeptical when I purchased this TV . I wasn't sure if an entry level TCL will be a good choice but I am pleasantly surprised . The TV has great colors and is bright enough for my place with plenty ambient lighting .It really does excel with HD content . That includes 1080p and 4k . The one Con that I see is that HDR content get pretty dark and almost un watchable . Good thing that I am not a videophile and 4k in itself looks so good on the TV that I ended up disabling HDR altogether. There is a secret menu on the TV that will let you disable HDR and I am so happy that TCL actually included that setting . The ROKU interface is the best thing about this TV. It's so simple and easy to navigate . I don't think that I'd get a better TV in this price range . I'd recommend to upgrade to a point anywhere remote instead of the line of sight remote that ships with the TV. They sell those here at walmart.com for like $20 , you will thank me later. Word of advice if you are mounting this TV, the mounting holes are at the bottom part of the TV , so you'll need to make sure that the mounting bracket that you are purchasing is not peeking form behind the TV.

"October 3, 2020",TCL is Fantastic brand,"This 55 in is my 4th TCL TV. In my opinion they are the best price/performance manufacturer on the market. Pay attention to what Series You are buying. They are all good, but choice should depend on what room and what u will be watching. For example, for your main room for watching I wouldnt consider anything less than the 6 series. Compares to Samsung's best at less than half the cost. For bedroom watching, the 4 or 5 series are definitely good enough. You can also buy aftermarket long term insurance policies for peanuts in case anything goes wrong. Integrated ROKU is also a big plus. I eliminated all my cable boxes because I can stream everything through ROKU. XFINITY even wants you to eliminate their boxes, they are the ones who told me how. Saving $10 a month per box is a big savings. You really cant go wrong with TCL.","TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",5.0

The feet on the TV are very widespread and splay out at an angle. You will need a TV tray thats at least 48 inches for the splayed feet. There is not a very good bracket on the back for mounting. on the right hand side of the red Roku display there are large ads which you cant get rid of. Positives: price for value was great. Picture quality is good as is sound. In a small to medium-sized room, you wont need a soundbar. Set-up was easy. Its well-protected in the package with plenty of foam and cardboard.

The one thing I am not too fond of is the light (sensor) at the bottom stays on until I physically turn off the TV; the remote will not do it.

"September 26, 2020",Read if you are on the fence..,"I put a solid amount of time into purchasing a 75 inch 4k tv. A few of the negative reviews on here almost pushed me away completely. A tv in this price range is absolutely amazing! I have a high end 60 inch 4k Samsung as well. There are things you need to consider before you purchase. Reviews says this TCL doesn't get bright at all, but it'll also depend on the room setting and lighting that shines in. My bay windows are off to the side, and I see very little glare off the window directly across from the tv. If your room is very bright, you may want to spend much more on 4k TVs that get extensively bright. But I also went into the picture settings and tweaked them to where I have the brightness and clarity just about perfect. I also added a 4 year warranty for $99 on top of a greatly priced $700 75 inch Roku TV. That's hard to beat! I also changed my speaker settings to ""Theatre"" and switched it to Dolby Surround and I was pleasantly surprised! I don't even need my soundbar honestly. I wrote this to help some out that may be where I was. Make sure you check your room environment, and understand you're looking at the 4 series. Of course it won't compete fully with $3000 4k tvs, but to be honest, with the tweaking I did I can't tell a difference. They say the TCL 6 series gets a bit brighter, so if you have the money, you may want that. I'm completely happy with the 4 series!

"November 29, 2018","Horrible Support, Trading Broken TV for Broken TV","Purchased in the beginning of the year, because of great size and picture with HDR. I started noticing these dark lighting strips on the screen and notified TCL support. TCL said they were sending out a replacement TV after I sent them pictures. They told me they could only send re-furbished TV's because I bought it over 6 months ago. The TV's would be installed onsite by one of there 3rd party installers. The first TV arrived a few weeks later to the 3rd party installers and was DOA... so they had to send it back. After phone calls to support I was informed they were sending another TV to the installers which would take a few more weeks... When the TV installer received the TV and came over to set it up, the box was trashed and multiply re-taped. After setting up the TV we found the screen wasn't even attached to the frame correctly and light was bleeding through. Also, the HDR function did not work at all, this was tested using an XBOX One X. I had the tech re-box the TV and send it back, after he took multiple pictures of the broken TV for his supervisor. To this day I still do not have a replacement TV, and TCL has sent this to ""Supervisor"".... just to be straight I'm in my second month trying to get this fixed.","TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",1.0

I was having shadowing so I was at the store went into the electrical TV section ask for help told them my situation and asked to see floor model guy played around couldn't get TV to stay on he told me to go home and adjust the TV. Well 30 day's later my TV is overheating it was 81 degrees in room it was very hot outside humidity. Well I called TCL 1yr manufacturer is a joke he told me to purchase a fan and put on a TV that was 31 day's old and to wait it out until it goes out my 3yr protection plan told me after a yr they can return TV to them and get refunded in a egiftcard that don't work or a check that cost to cash without bank and TV could go up in price in a yr. Well if I was buyer's make sure you like ur TV within the first 3wks or you will go threw 3 different agency and they all will mess with ur time. Good advice watch ur TV in a high heat about 85 to 90 degrees room temperature and if don't over heat it may pass but I think these TV don't stand higher heat then 78 degrees as mine running at. 88 degrees is what my energy efficient TV is average heat with temperature laser gun gauge. Good luck I purchase a 32in 3 yrs ago and it didn't over heat in my spare room at 95 degrees. So it my TV or the manufacturer of the 43in TCL faulty issues.

It’s so loud to where you can be watching at a reasonable volume and you will wake up other people in the house late night. It’s only on the roku TV. This doesn’t happen on my Apple TV or fire stick. Super annoying and they need a “Volume Leveling” setting in the audio settings which doesn’t exist. It’s super annoying how loud the commercials get.

I have tried every troubleshooting step from powering it off to on all the way to factory resetting the device. The only step that works is factory resetting and re-configuring the TV again, which means taking another 15 minutes of set-up and another few minutes to login to your apps every time.

So I got on Goggle and researched 55"" TCL TVs and found that many others had the same issue with this TV. So it kind of sucks as I shouldn't be looking for a new TV right now (didn't get an extended warranty)!

They said they would send me a new email so that I can choose a TCL model in the next few days. I will update my review.

I had it shipped to Wally World to save on the shipping cost. Just be forwarned, the box this came in was HUGE. It barley fit in the bed of my F150. The TV starts up fast and is very quick to go from app to app. I HIGHLY recommend using the Roku app for your phone, you can control everything with your phone, I mean EVERYTHING. Also, the app allows you to use your bluetooth headphones to hear without waking the baby. Oh and if you are not going to wall mount it, your TV stand needs to be at least 63” long and 16” wide (minimum). Anything less than those dimentions and it may not sit correctly and safely on your TV stand.

The picture quality is excellent, and we love the Roku integration. The sound quality is a bit lacking though. Less than a year later all of the HDMI ports stop working, which means no game console or DVD players will operate. We put in a work order through TCL, and luckily it was still under warranty. After going through all of their steps over the phone to no avail, they sent out a technician with a new tv. Awesome! Well, here we are a year out from that, and last night the picture on the tv suddenly went black. The sound was still working, just no picture, and no backlight at all. Completely dark. We have unhooked and rebooked everything, rebooted, and even factory reset the tv. Still no picture. In my troubleshooting I have discovered this to be a problem with a lot of people, and issues have even been reported to the BBB. We have put in a maintenance request and are awaiting contact from a technician, but their website says there could be a wait due to Covid-19 issues. It seems that these tvs are built without demand for quality workmanship. A television should last longer than a year. If TCL does not replace this existing tv due to warranty issues, we will definitely not be buying another, and I would absolutely urge everyone to look at a different manufacturer when shopping for a smart TV.","TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",1.0

"September 5, 2020",Ok TV for the price,"Picture quality was good, but the sound is way to low. You literally have to put it at 75 to hear it well but it’s understandable because it only has 10w speakers so it’s best to have it connected to a sound bar. The lack of 120 refresh rate is well display when watching live sports all you see is a blurry player running back and forth. But this isn’t a $1500 tv so you get what you pay for and in this care $700 is what you get. 4K content not so great the picture is dark and not as sharp as it should be, and after many adjustments same thing. Is this tv worth the purchase yes if you want low quality and a big size TV then yes. But if you are looking for a great 4K tv experience then no. You will be disappointed in the sound and picture quality. My suggestion is to wait it out save a few extra hundreds and but a better TV.

"August 27, 2020",Only One Complaint,"First off I was shocked at how light this TV is and how easy the unboxing was. I like how it was boxed well and protected. Hook up and set up was fast and simple. It does have a cheap plastic feel to the TV and the remote is simple. Only having the main buttons required. I actually didn't like the remote. It is small, the volume up, down and mute buttons are located on the side of the remote. Anyone that has never had a Roku might find some of the buttons confusing. What I feel TLC focused on the most was the pitcher quality. It has an excellent 4K pitcher for the price. Still not full HDR though. Some of the bright sunny areas are bleached out. But not a major concern at this price. Kinda worried on the panel life at this price. You tend to get what you pay for. Only time will tell. You take good care of it and it will take care of you. Now to my only complaint. It doesn't come with the av pig tell adapter. Most TVs I've purchases in the past came with it. Not sure why this TV did not. So if you are one of the select few that still uses RCA's. This may not be the TV for you.","TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",4.0
"September 14, 2020","TCL TV's have a new fan! Pretty impressed, so far!","Just bought a TCL 43"" 4K 43S421 OPEN BOX to replace a just bought TCL 32"" because it was a little too small (worked fine). The TV is going to be mainly used for Xbox and my son said the 43"" was much clearer (not surprising 4K versus 720p) and faster. I decided to attach a small HD antenna just to see what would happen and was able to tune in the Patriots/Dolphins game and the picture was pretty darn good. I will try to hook up cable later (have to find the right cable wire) but it might be worth getting a real HD antenna as I found myself watching the game on that TV rather than the 1080 I have in the living room. I'll keep and eye on it and try to update this rating as it goes along.","TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",5.0

With great power comes great confusion. There are so many bells and whistles it will take a while to set this up. Before even plugging it in, I discovered that while the feet on it look symmetric, they are not, They have a definite front and back, and there are little tabs on the bottom of the frame to force the alignment. Once I plugged it in I found that I had to have my smart phone handy to sign up for (sign in to) a Roku account (free) and to log into my Amazon Prime account in order to access both of those features. Things were going well until I tried to watch TV from my cable box. The screen went all green. I tested all three HDMI ports with the same result from that and my DVD player. The one common element was the TV. Watching content from the internet was fine. In fact, an excellent picture. I was ready to box the TV up and take it back, but after messing around again the problem went away. We will see if it comes back. If not, I will be totally satisfied with this TV. I had considered getting a 65"" model, but decided it was just to big for my space. This replaces an 8 year old 55"" TCL that developed a pixel width vertical black line. I paid less than half for this TV than I did for my old one. If you are not tech savvy then you better find someone who is to help you set this up.

The 4k is clear and the HDR looks great once you set it up. Only downsides to this are that the glare isn't that great when the sun from windows hit it and you need to set the HDR on your t.v to automatic with the Roku phone app in advanced settings for it to not look washed out. Just Google how to and you'll be fine. It runs cool compared to my old Vizio that I had which is always a nice bonus since the PS4 Pro can heat up a tad when using the HDR on the Television. Overall the price is great when you look at how good the picture looks and it sounds.

After hearing some horror stories about people receiving cracked TVs from Amazon, I decided to head over to Walmart... their online price was comparable to what Amazon was offering.

Much to my surprise, it being Super Bowl Sunday, the TV was even less than I was prepared to pay.

I called TCL customer support and they had me try several different things, unsuccessfully I might add. Then, they basically told me that my TV was trash but I could take it to a repair shop.

"April 3, 2020",AVOID THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY TO THROW AWAY!,"AVOID THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY TO THROW AWAY! The TV at first was too good to be true. At the time of purchase, 4k, was a thing that only certain people could invest or make the switch to. Well, TCL was giving me the opportunity to switch, and at a price that was very questionable. So just like others, I fell into the trap. I purchased the 65' 4k TCL TV thinking this would give my living room some flare. It did until one normal day, the entire screen went black. So I did a factory reset and then it turned on like normal. BUT it wasn't normal. Some of the pixels on the screen never managed to ignite. I reached out to TCL's customer service thinking TCL will fix my problem because most companies stand behind their product, right? Wrong again. TCL asked me for the serial number and told me that since the pixels was slightly spaced apart, they couldn't help me. Overall, the customer experience was okay, at least they added a little bit of empathy when delivering the bad news. Me, This Guy, will NEVER buy another TCL product again. I purchased a Samsung Qled since. Whats the saying, buy once, cry once? Well spend your money wisely. If you have the ability to save and purchase the main thing you'll see for a few ""years"" at a time, buy a better brand. PRO: Price and they also teach their customer service reps on how to use empathy.

"January 21, 2020",Roku TV Review,"This is my first experience with a smart tv. Over all I really like it. It is a good screen size, has good picture quality, and has excellent sound. Some things you need to know- The front of the box shows 2 remotes. You only get one remote. It is the Roku remote. The big draw back here is there are no numbers on the remote so you can't just punch in a channel number. You have to scroll thru all the channels. Not a big deal if you have antenna tv and only have 30 or so channels. But even then it is aggravating. So if you have satellite and have over 300 channels it is going to be aggravating when you are on channel 23 and need to scroll to 240. Another thing I do not like is the TV picks your favorite channels for you. Those channels are then put separate from the other channels. So if you are on channel 27 and want to go to 29 and it has picked 29 as a favorite for you (it chooses them by how often you watch them) then when you scroll up through the channels it goes 27, 28, 30. Number 29 is taken out and put in your favorites. So you have to scroll back to the first to access the favorite channels. You do get an on screen tv guide even with antenna tv. So that is a good thing. I had to call support to get some help setting the TV up. You will be talking to someone in another country but the lady talked to was really nice and really helpful even though at times extremely hard to understand. You do not get any kind of book with the tv. I guess you are suppose to just go online. I could not even really find any type of owner manual. You get a folded up paper that is a set up guide with the TV. Most questions I have had I either googled or sent an email. Sending an email has been my best communication. They always have answered. I would recommend this TV and if I wanted another large screen or smart tv I would go with Roku. I have also recently learned the tv (being hooked to the internet) basically does spy on you. It knows what dvds you watch. I guess that is not a big deal. My computer knows what websites I visit. So it is no different. I did not realize this was happening until I popped an old dvd in and a disclaimer pops up apologizing because the show was from long ago and may be offensive. It was a Tom and Jerry cartoon. smh This model does not have a camera nor does it have a microphone. You can't just tell the tv to go to this or that channel. The TV literally has thousands of apps you can download. Some you need a subscription for and you will pay for it. Some are free. Or they have free stuff and things you can pay for. Roku also has a channel that has tons of free stuff on it as well. You also do not have to connect a credit card to your Roku to be able to have a Roku account. And you will need one to use the TV. There is a way to bypass that when you set up the account. You may need to contact support for help. Having the CC already connected make is easier if you plan to purchase a lot.","TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",5.0

TCL BECAME POPULAR IN WINTER/SPRING 2017. IF YOU SIMPLY GOOGLE THE BLACK SCREEN ISSUE ,YOU WILL SEE AN UNGODLY NUMBER OF REPORTS OF FAILURES BETWEEN YEAR 1 (END OF WARRANTY) AND YEAR 2. It starts like this: intermittent black screen with audio that seems to fix itself. ***Countdown to worsening intermittent failure has begun. It will progress to a point that you need to unplug or factory reset it to bring it back. ***Countdown to imminent complete failure has begun. COMPLETE FAILURE: WILL REQUIRE T-CON BOARD AND/OR POWER BOARD REPLACEMENT AND/OR POSSIBLE LED STRIPS. IF YOU ELECT TO REPAIR, IT IS AT YOUR OWN RISK OF IT SIMPLY HAPPENING AGAIN AS THE PARTS ARE NOT UPDATED TO STOP THE ISSUE (TCL doesn't even acknowledge the failures are happening). Keep in mind the pricing for TCL has dropped 1/3 -1/2 of what they were just 2 years ago. So odds are, unless you are willing and able to repair it yourself, you will wind up simply replacing the TCL tv (but hopefully not with the same brand. At least until they learn to take care of the buyers that gave them a chance and got burned 13-24 months after purchase). In my case, 65s405 / 23 months / $900 WASTED. JUST GOOGLE IT.

Others have had the same issue. I can test via Android phone and Windows laptop with no drop in speed or connectivity.

"January 21, 2020","This TCL TV is a defective product, do not buy!","The TCL ROKU 55"" TV is a faulty product with a manufacturing defect that causes the backlights to shut down quickly and without notice. I purchased this TV for $349 in November, 2018 and immediately had it professionally hung on my wall. Had settings use a ""flashing time"" screensaver with intent to maximize lifetime of my product. Also purchased Roku Surround Sound speakers which I wirelessly attached to the TV for $149 - these worked great, but are useless until I purchase a new TV. Came home in January, 2020 to a black screen. When you power the TV on, it shows a 1 second flash of the red ""TCL * ROKU TV* screen, then nothing. Audio works when using the remote to adjust the volume. Tried powering off then on, then unplugging and waiting, finally attempted a factory reset per TCL's ""troubleshooting"" instructions. None worked. I could faintly see the visuals that are supposed to appear when holding a flashlight to the TV. TCL does not care or attempt to engage me with a solution to this. Their position is that I should have purchased a longer rebate with the retailer than the 1 year warranty that comes with the product. Mind you, I've spent $500 plus tax only FOURTEEN MONTHS ago on this product that has been kept in mint condition. If this backlight issue happened after 7 years, or even 5, I'd have accepted that. But TCL puts out products that offer an unacceptably short life. This is a manufacturing defect, not the fault of the retailer! I've searched this issue on Google and found a disturbingly high number of people with TCL product issues similar to mine. Bringing it to a TV repair shop will cost over 50% of the cost of the TV, with no warranty of future success if fixed. There are at-home TV repair kits for sale for $60 plus shipping and accompanying YouTube videos that are mindblowingly complex on fixing motherboards, ""T-Con boards"" or the LED lights. In short, I have a huge, useless black screen in my living room until I buy a new one and pay also for IT to be professionally hung.

"January 22, 2020","TCL 65"" HDR Roku Smart TV - Is A Great TV!!","I purchased the 65"" Hisense TV.. When I turned it on, it had red spots in the screen that wouldn't go away. Walmart refunded my purchase. I didn't want to take a chance on the Hisense again, so I purchased the TCL 65"" HDR Roku Smart LED TV (652425).. Boy am I glad I did.. It has features that the other didn't have.. First it has a great picture, it up scales TV and Movies to near 4K quality. (But Not every one of them). It is also has a 120 frame rate instead of the 60 that many of them have. This gives you an image easier on the eyes. Of course if you want to be a cable cutter. There is plenty of free TV and Movies.. In addition to the Roku channel. You want to install Pluto. Pluto has free TV and Movies.. You have to register your email with them following their instructions, however it is worth it for the over 100 live free stations that you can flip through with your remote just like having cable TV, and it also has a Movie section that you can go to. There are other free Movie Apps that you can find by doing a search. But Pluto is our favorite of them.. Hope this review helps.. It is a great TV for the price..","TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",5.0

"November 8, 2019",TCL is the get it right the first time choice.,"TCL makes THE best affordable 4k tvs in its price range. Picture quality, color and crispness @ 60hrtz does not disappoint. This tv never failed, never glitched and I never felt I needed to do something to get more out of it such that I felt I needed a better tv. It does well what it's designed to do out of the box. I recently sold my 43"" TCL 4 SERIES, to buy a 5 series 50"" with the Dollby vision. A lovely upgrade. It sold in under twenty-four hours, and was in perfect condition. I was proud to sell it and represent that the tv would not disappoint my buyer. TCL is certainly the best budget choice that comes with no issues in the design and picture quality. Start up is always fast, color and crispness is calibrated such that it requires little if any tweaking out of box. Set up with WiFi is fast and simple. 3 HDMI ports are enough to start with. Roku platform works as expected. This is a no headaches tv. The same is like true of all TCL TVs. Turn it on and it simply works. This tv does not do 120hrtz soap opera effect. Brightness is decent. Color is quite good, but remember the 4 series is not a higher end Dolby Vision tv, so you won't get that extra color range you would easily notice in tvs that have it. Sound quality is good but not great so...you know what to do. Headphone jack is on the right side. If you're on a budget or need an inexpensive get it right the first time 4k tv, don't dally, get a TCL ROKU TV.","TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",5.0

After trying many audio settings the 'echo' subsided somewhat but not completely but the voices did not synchronize with lip movement. I found no feature that would restore voice/picture synchronization. That condition remained until I returned the TCL to Walmart and selected another brand. I searched the internet for ""TCL Sound"" issues and found a large blog where many buyers complained of the same problems I had. I would not recommend this brand.","TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",1.0

"October 8, 2019",TCL 55S421 - Read this before you buy.,I won't give it a bad review because it is a budget tv. My main gripe is the remote is featureless. No direct channel input so if you are on cable ch 96 and need to change to 3 it takes a while to get there changing 1 at the time. The way the tv is built even an aftermarket harmony remote cannot be used for direct entry. No input button on the remote requiring you to go to the home screen each time to select an input.

Here's what you need to know to save yourselves some grief and frustration. First get your tv where you want it in your house. DO NOT PLUG IT IN YET. Adjust it so viewing is good. The next thing you need to do is set up a Roku account. Don't add a credit card, you can skip that part. Sometimes on tablets and phones you can't see you can skip that part. I used my laptop. Once you get signed in stay signed in. Now plug in your tv. You will go thru the setup including getting your wifi password on the tv. You will see the code to enter to activate your tv, the address will look something like this roku.com/link or something similar. Remember you're still signed in to roku, don't sign out. go to the roku address provided and add your code. Your tv will get activated. If you try to do without being signed in to roku it won't work. Well it didn't work until I signed in. That's my experience and I hope this helps. Good Luck.","TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",4.0

Within a few minutes, done. There are advanced controls for color if you want to experiment or have specific needs. Otherwise, the presets are just fine. Since budget was a concern, I compared specs carefully to see what the trade-off would be. The picture is great so I don't see that anything was sacrificed. We added a soundbar for more robust audio. One caveat, unless the TV is wall-mounted, pay attention to the height of the soundbar. Our Yamaha system is just tall enough to block the remote signal unless you aim down from a high angle. Not a real problem, though. I'm a big fan of the Roku platform. Combined with the excellent quality of the set, it is a great choice.","TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",5.0

But given the crisp audio and beautiful picture quality, I am more than satisfied with my purchase. One review stated that there was problems with the sound. Thus far, I haven't had any issues with that but I prefer to use a sound bar, so that make it null and void.

"November 8, 2019","Great picture, even better value!","I've had this television for almost a year now and feel compelled to write this review. First, this TV is cheaper now than when I bought mine, so it is an even better value. What I must share is how brilliant the picture is! Depending upon broadcast quality, when the signal is truly a 4K broadcast, the picture is nothing short of amazing! The light weight of the unit allows it to be mounted just about anywhere. It is so slim that it fits tightly to the wall as well. Having ROKU built in is also a convenient feature. If there is any weakness, it would be the audio quality. However, most folks will add a sound bar, like I did, and the weak audio is a non-issue. All in all, this unit offers video quality far beyond its price range and great convenience. I'll buy another TCL when the time comes, but I don't expect that to be for quite a while.","TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",5.0

"September 2, 2019",Roku Smart LED TV (55S421) --The good and the bad.,"It looks very good, and the Roku interface has most of the features you get with a standard remote (once you get the hang of it). It also saves you from buying a Roku box if you were in the market for one. The Roku interface (just like with a Roku box) permits a great number of streaming apps and works very well. The TV will also do its best to present the correct aspect resolution for the channel content if it varies (480,760,1080 or 4K) when in Auto mode. Other settings are available. What is not too good is: - The 120hz for motion. Even when watching the news, the news person will blur a little as they move across the set. The faster they move the more they blur. I have not found a setting yet that will lessen the effect. The 4K does not seem to have the same issue. I think sports viewing like football might be a little too blurry at low resolution, but I have not tried it yet. - There is no way to just jump from one channel to another as you can with a remote with a number pad. But you can do switching between current channel and last viewed. - It seems to have no optical sensor for the rooms ambient light. That may be a good thing -- because my last TV had it and I had multiple settings for it anyway. The five preset settings can be reconfigured to remember your settings for each and thus can be used as brightness presets. - I wish the Roku remote had a few programmable buttons for other devices or apps. Overall a very good TV for the price. I paid $318. The 4K resolution is spectacular. And YouTube has a lot of 4K content. I also use an antenna (The usual auto programming) for TV reception and it works quite well, and gives a signal strength indicator for each channel. Switching between channels is done via a programming grid (displayed via the left arrow button), of simple up down selection using the up and down buttons. -Note: if you have a sound bar and the TV is on a table, then you will have to raise the TV up by about two inches to get the soundbar under the TV. It cannot be in front of it because it will block the TV's Roku remote sensor which is on the bottom center of the TV.","TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",4.0

The Vizeo has a better upconvert engine (old TV shows are surprisingly sharp) and excellent black uniformity and contrast....dark scenes really pop. I kept the TCL and returned the Vizio because the V made sunny summer scenes look gloomy or overcast. Even studio scenes like News broadcasts were not right, and when you up the color setting, faces get way too red. I couldn't give up the sunny day scenes. They both have their strong points for sure. Both are good, neither is perfect. Both require alot of adjusting to get the best picture.

I have loved the Roku TV ecosystem for some time now, and although I used to be cautious of the TCL brand, this TV has been serving me quite well. The picture has been fantastic, sound won't blow you away but there's nothing to gripe about for the price, and the smart TV abilities work without a hitch. If I had to pick one thing to choose one thing to complain about, it would be the backlight bleed. Darker scenes mixed with a low-light viewing environment will make it evident that the backlight isn't even across the panel. Given, if you're not looking for this kind of thing, you're probably not going to notice it. However, if it's something you care about, then you're probably going to be annoyed by it.

"June 6, 2019",Okay if you're sitting directly in front of it!,"The viewing angle is bad on this TV. You have to be directly in front of it for the best picture. This is mostly common for LED TVs, but this TV is the worst when it comes down to viewing angles. Try viewing this TV from an angle on the side (like a couch on the right or left side of the TV) and you'll notice the picture gets washed out and has a greenish tint to it. Viewing from these side angles isn't ideal at all! The sound of the speakers is okay. Its not good enough if you want a home theatre experience. Add a sound bar if sound is important to you. But good luck with that, as most sound bars won't fit well in front of this TV. They'll be too tall and block the bottom half of the TV. The picture quality is good when viewed directly in front of the TV. It shows it's HDR 10 compatible, but upon further research you'll notice this TV can barely be qualified as that. 4K resolution is okay, but you'll have to be close to the TV to notice any extra detail in the 4K content. I'd say if you're big into 4K, look for a TV with Dolby Vision for the best 4K picture. This model doesn't have it, but newer model TCLs do.","TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",3.0
"March 31, 2019",Facts about TCL television,"I just have to write this review because I researched extensively before I decided to step into the Walmart Store to buy this television. Finally, I walked into the Walmart store that fateful day with my spouse to decide for myself and of all the different brand names that I saw displayed in the store, these TCL televisons indeed were outstanding televisions among the rest we saw (including LG, Samsung, Vizio, Sharp...name them). I had to step into the store and personally saw different televisions on display and even with the normal Store Television Settings that make them brighter and all, the TCL beat them all like I said earlier in terms of clarity, picture quality and overall superior performance and quality appearance. I was immediately struck by the fact that the reviews I had been reading about the tcl tvs might not all be over-rated after all. We bought the tv. When I got home and set it up with Home Use setting, I noticed one thing: the clarity of the picture and the quality is still as outstanding as it was in the store. It is really amazing like other reviews say, and it has remained the same. My conclusion: the television cannot be beat even by the brand names, If you have the chance, pick it up. The reviews are truly correct. Another suggestion, step into any store (Best Buy, Walmart or Target ) and see the different tvs for yourself and see what I mean. And most of all, the Company stands by their product (I see how they quickly respond to customers in reviews) The reviews are true indeed. I was skeptical initially in my researches. But for a fact, TCL is a quality product. The Roku interface is great. The set up is a breeze. Connectivity and UHD dispays are awesome.; and yet I have just regular internet connection. I am enjoying this television so much. Like others have been saying, I am sure my next buy is TCL, that is if they don't jump the band-wagon of price increase in the future. TCL...just keep up the good old American quality product at socially reasonable price , like you do now. And I will always come back you can bet, as I have other kids rooms to put in tv's too.","TCL 75"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 75S421",5.0
